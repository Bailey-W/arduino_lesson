# HacKSU Arduino Lesson  
**Presented by**: Bailey Wimer  
Special thanks to the Advanced Telerobotics Research Lab  
## Setup  
Before beginning, make an account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 can be simulated using their circuit simulation tool.  
Circuit 3 is more complex and must be built physically, but a list of parts will be provided.
